Calculation of Harmonics in the Course Application Of Derivatives.

# Usage and Importance

We often face a problem with calculating the values of Harmonics, which is often a very lengthy calculation. As of today (05-06-2022) there does not exist a calculator that automates the process of calculating the harmnoics values and saves valuable time. I propose here an approach that has been implemented in Python, that gives us the output as the harmonic values.

- We can edit the X and Y values in the dataframes as required. 
- X is in Radians, while Y is the function output.
- You can calculate Harmonics upto n numbers by editing out the comments.
- Theorotically this problem can be solved by the steps followed in this Youtube Video by Dr. Gajendra Purohit:

<h3>Importance:</h3>

- A harmonic function is a two-variable mathematical function whose value at any place is equal to the average of its values around any circle about that point, assuming the function is defined inside the circle. 
- Because this average involves an infinite number of points, it must be calculated using an integral, which represents an infinite sum. 
- Harmonic functions explain equilibrium conditions in physical contexts, such as temperature or electrical charge distribution over an area, where the value at each location remains constant.
